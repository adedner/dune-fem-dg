The vector of conservative variables is $\vecU=(\rho, \rho\vecv, \rho\theta)^\trans$.
$\rho$ is the density, $\theta$ the potential temperature, and
$\vecv=(v_1,...,v_d)^T$ the velocity field.
$\mathcal{F}(\vecU) = (\mathcal{F}_i(\vecU))$ and
$\mathcal{A}(\vecU)\nabla\vecU = ((\mathcal{A}(\vecU)\nabla \vecU)_i )$ for $i=1,...,d$, are
given as follows:
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{F}_i(\vecU)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
    \rho v_i \\
    \rho v_1 v_i  + \delta_{1i}p \\
    \vdots \\
    \rho v_d v_i + \delta_{di} p \\
    v_i \rho\theta  \\
  \end{array}\right),\qquad 
  \big (\mathcal{A}(\vecU)\nabla\vecU \big )_i =\mu\rho\left(\begin{array}{c}
    0                \\
    \partial_i v_1   \\ 
    \vdots           \\ 
    \partial_i v_d   \\
    \partial_i\theta \\
  \end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
with $\mu$ being the kinematic viscosity.
The source term $\mathcal{S}$ is only acting on the last component of the velocity field, i.e.
$\mathcal{S}(\vecU) = (0,...,0,-\rho g,0)^T$ with
$g$ being the constant of the gravitation force.
To close the system we define the pressure $p$ in accordance with the
ideal gas law $p = p_0\left(\frac{\rho\gasconst\theta}{p_0}\right)^\gamma$,
where $\gamma=c_p/c_v$ is the heat capacity ratio and $c_p$ and $c_v$ are specific
heat capacities under constant pressure and volume, respectively.
The individual gas constant is defined as $\gasconst=c_p-c_v$.
%In equation (\ref{eqn:eos}) 
%$p_0$ is the standard reference pressure,
For the standard reference pressure $p_0$ we choose $p_0=10^5$~Pa.
