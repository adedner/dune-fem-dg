This file determines the order how things appear in the doxygen
documentation within the Grid group. It works like this:

\defgroup commands appear only in this file here which is
parsed before the other files (because it is mentioned first 
in the Doxyfile).

Only \addtogroup is used in the code documentation.

\defgroup ParameterClass Parameter classes

Parameter classes collect information (usually) from parameter files.

Parameter classes are usually closely linked to a class where the
parameters may change the state of an object of this class.

Main goal of parameter classes are
1. _encapsulation_ of parameter information for the usage in another class,
2. easy _modification_ of the state of an object,
3. allow _key prefixes_ to read local parameters from a parameter files,
4. allow _user-defined implementation_ to change the state of an object in a user-defined way.
