DUNE-FEM-DG is the implementation of Discontinuous Galerkin schemes
using the DUNE-FEM framework. Stabilized DG schemes for hyperbolic
as well as a wide range of different primal formulations
for elliptic/parabolic problems are implemented.
The operators can be used efficiently both in a
explicit/matrix free implementation or used to
setup a system matrix for use with the linear solvers available in DUNE-FEM.

The DUNE-FEM-DG module is available under
the GNU General Public License version 2, or (at your option),
any later version.

A detailed description of the schemes can be found
in the first two papers and an overview on performance of
the code is given in the third paper.
